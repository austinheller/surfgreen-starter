# Surfgreen Starter

Get started with the Surfgreen static site generator. Learn more at [surfgreen.xyz](https://surfgreen.xyz).

## Previewing your site

Out of the box, Surfgreen comes with a local development server you can use to view your site before you publish it. When you open the site in your browser, pages will auto-update as you edit your site's files.

Type `npm start`. When you launch, you'll see a message:

```
Surf's up! Your site is ready for local preview:

[Preview URL]
```

Open that preview url in your web browser. As you edit your site, it will automatically update with your latest changes.

## Building your site

Type `npm run build` to generate a build of your site. (A *build* is the public-ready website that Surfgreen generates when you run this command.)

Assuming it's successful, you'll see the following message:

```
Hang ten! Your site has completed building, and can be found in your site's /build folder.

If you're deploying this site from a hosting service, make sure the public root is also set to /build.

Happy surfing!
```
